* There is no evolution of the standard deviation for individual traits. An offspring inherits the sigma value from the donor gene (Look at TD-Lambda)
  
  PARTIALLY RESOLVED: There is a naive implementation of TD-Lambda that sets the standard deviation between a minimum and maximum value.
    It is based on the fitness of the chromosome the trait came from (see Trait.new_standard_deviation_from(fitness)).

* Caching note (Keep RMSD fitness calculation on the chromosome itself so it doesn't need to be recomputed every iteration)
  
  PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Chromosomes now have a fitness attribute, but it is not assigned anywhere. 
    If Calculator.meiosis(chromosome_1, chromosome_2) is called and either chromosome is missing a fitness value, an error is raised.

* Move away from testing methods with randomness over many calls, and use a behavior-driven approach instead.
